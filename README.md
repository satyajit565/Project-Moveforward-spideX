# servo_calibration_by_using-_PCA9685
This project focuses on calibrating servo motors using the PCA9685 16-channel PWM driver. Each servo is accurately set to 90 degrees (midpoint position) before mechanical assembly. After positioning, servo horns (servo caps) are mounted onto the servo shafts to ensure proper alignment and symmetry in robotic mechanisms like legs or arms.
